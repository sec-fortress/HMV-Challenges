In the script's silent dance, spaces weave,	   	  	       	 
A hidden language, easy to deceive.       	     	   	  	     
Between the lines, where eyes might stray, 	      	 	      
The secret dwells in whitespace's play.	       	     	     	       
	    	   		      	  	  	       	 	   
Embrace the gaps, where silence gleams, 	   	 	      	   
Decode the whispers in code's dreams. 	  	      	  	       	 
In every blank, a story told, 	  	     	   	 	       	   
For beginners bold, a mystery unfolds.
